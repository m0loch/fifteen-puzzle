# fifteen-puzzle
A simple puzzle for my personal site

_by Romeo Graifenberg_

## Description
React component embedding a simple, classic puzzle.

## How to use
Import it as a submodule on git / import the code in the project.
Use it as a component.

## Required libraries
@material-ui/core

## Work that still needs to be done
1. controls
    - implement click/tap on tile
    - implement swipe
2. creation of the initial, randomized state
    - shuffle box + parity check
3. win condition

## Note
Given the way the grid is built, animating the moves seems unfeasible
